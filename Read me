This project compares Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest classifiers on the MAGIC Gamma Telescope dataset. The goal is to classify high-energy gamma particles and hadrons based on 10 real-valued features.

Name: MAGIC Gamma Telescope

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

Target classes:

g: Gamma rays

h: Hadrons (background noise)

Data Preprocessing:

Outlier detection

Feature scaling (for SVM)

Label encoding

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Feature distribution plots

Correlation heatmap

Feature importance (Random Forest)

Model Comparison:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest Classifier

GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

âœ… Results
Best Model: Random Forest

}
Conclusion: Random Forest performed better, likely due to its ability to handle feature interactions and outliers more effectively than SVM.
